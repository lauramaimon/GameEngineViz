You enter a room with two buttons. Nothing happens when you press one... You wonder what would happen if you pressed both at once. Your buddy Toad is in the room too, but he just sits there. You could try picking him up... How do you do that, again?

Hint: The green button is pretty hard to press down. You think Toad might not weigh enough.

Hint: Making an object a child of another changes the origin of its coordinate system to the parent's position. This is useful for attaching objects to other objects.
