You enter a room with four buttons. Nothing happens when you press one... You wonder what would happen if you pressed two at once. Your buddy Toad is in the room too, but he just sits there. You could try picking him up... How do you do that, again?

Hint: The green button is pretty hard to press down. You think Toad might not weigh enough.
